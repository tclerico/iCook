## Product Goal
To generate one-tray-meals and recommend recipes based off the food available to a user

## Description

Cooking is by far one of the greatest skills to learn. To be able to feed oneself is key to a happy, healthy life. But when you are trying to learn, what do you buy? Many people might say that you pick a recipe you'd like to try and buy those ingredients while making sure to keep staples like flour, butter, and eggs constantly stocked.

I find that it is very easy for me to fall into a cycle of creating a recipe that I enjoy, and shopping only for ingredients in that recipe.iCook aims to break the paradigm that you need to have a recipe in mind before shopping.

iCook will keep track of what ingredients are around the house and suggest a number of recipes for your meal time. It can also generate a "1 tray meal", where all ingredients are roasted on a single tray and put in the oven at different times in such a way that all parts of the meal
are completed at the same time.

This app is targeted towards people who enjoy cooking but want to improve, as well as people who may struggle to eat regularly due to not knowing what/how to cook.
iCook will help these users discover the foods they enjoy.

## Starting Scenarios

In order to keep track of ingredients
As a hungry person/ chef person 
I want to be able to save an inventory of my ingredients

Chefs are able to input the counts for their ingredients 

Given that the chef wants to add an ingredient 
When the chef adds the ingredient and the count 
Then the inventory  is updated

Given the chefs wants to get a count
When the chefs request a count for an ingredient
Then the chef gets a count for the ingredient

Scenario three:

Given that a chef wants to add a batch of ingredients 
When the chef gives a list of ingredients and counts 
Then the inventory is updated  

Scenario four:
