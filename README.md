## Description

Cooking is by far one of the greatest skills to learn. To be able to feed oneself is key to a happy, healthy life. But when you are trying to learn, what do you buy? Many people might say that you pick a recipe you'd like to try and buy those ingredients while making sure to keep staples like flour, butter, and eggs constantly stocked.

I find that it is very easy for me to fall into a cycle of creating a recipe that I enjoy, and shopping only for ingredients in that recipe.iCook aims to break the paradigm that you need to have a recipe in mind before shopping.

iCook will keep track of what ingredients are around the house and suggest a number of recipes for your meal time. It can also generate a "1 tray meal", where all ingredients are roasted on a single tray and put in the oven at different times in such a way that all parts of the meal
are completed at the same time.

This app is targeted towards people who enjoy cooking but want to improve, as well as people who may struggle to eat regularly due to not knowing what/how to cook.
iCook will help these users discover the foods they enjoy.
